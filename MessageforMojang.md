# Dear Mojang,

I'm sure "Eaglercraft" is a project that is at the top of your DMCA list. We (the Eagler-Archive team) are well aware that Minecraft costs around $30.


And the idea of Minecraft is that children or adults have fun on its platform, right?


But money can't buy happiness.


We're trying hard to make Minecraft HTML-friendly and you're violently threatening to shut us down or ban us from Github.
It's more fun when you can easily access Minecraft from a browser. Eaglercraft can run on school Chromebooks and give you decent photo speed.
I think your fanbase would be MUCH happier if you could access Minecraft that you didn't need to pay for and Minecraft WOULD skyrocket in popularity.


You should really consider this because some people think Minecraft is a dead game.
Don't do Minecraft just for the money. Have the joy and satisfaction of having children interested in YOUR play.
Also, why do you keep pulling Eaglercraft repositories via DMCA? The Eaglercraft client will continue to be built and forked on Github. It's like a fighter plane trying to catch a UFO.


Eaglercraft's goal was never to pirate the game, but simply to port it to the browser, and the years of time and effort invested in the port should not end so violently.
Thanks for reading <3
